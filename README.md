# Cucumber

This project is to learn about cucumber.

## Restrictions

1. Cucumber works with Node.js versions: 14 || 16 || 18>=.
2. To run cucumber tests, you can use the next 2 commands:
    - `npx cucumber-js`: native form
    - `npm test`: in this case you need setup your `package.json` file in the script `"test"` option, change the current value to `node ./node_modules/@cucumber/cucumber/bin/cucumber-js ./features`
